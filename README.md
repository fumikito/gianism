Connect user accounts with significant web services like Facebook, Twitter, etc. Stand on the shoulders of giants!

##  Description

##  Installation 

Install itself is easy. Auto installation from the admin panel is recommended. Search with `gianism`.

1. Download and unpack the plugin file, and upload `gianims` folder to `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate it from admin panel.

### Use latest source on GitHub

You can get this plugin from [github](https://github.com/fumikito/Gianism/). Clone it and run `composer install && npm install && npm start`. About composer and npm, google it.

###  How to set up 

After the plugin's activation, you have to set it up. Every setup has 2 steps. One is on SNS, the other is on your site.

For example, if you use Facebook, register a new app on Facebook, then input the app ID and token on the WordPress admin panel. Every SNS requires **registration of Apps** and **credentials related to it**.

For more details, please refer to the setting screen's instructions or our site [gianism.info](https://gianism.info/).
